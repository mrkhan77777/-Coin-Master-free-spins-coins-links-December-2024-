Buy chests in every village
Individual cards don’t offer any bonuses but completing a Card Collection does. You should always purchase as many Chests as you can afford when entering a new Village. Lower level Cards become more challenging to obtain as you go up in Village levels, so the early stages are the best places to get the low-level Cards you need to complete a Collection. There’s no worse feeling than having to spend a Joker to replace the missing standard Card that you could have gotten way back when you first started playing!

Checking here for daily links isn’t the only way that you can get Coin Master free spins and coins! Here are some additional ways you can get Coin Master codes.

Invite Facebook friends
Every time you invite a friend on Facebook to play the game, you can get 40 Coin Master free spins. To get these codes, your friend needs to accept the invite, download the game, open it, and log into Facebook, so their account is tied to the game. If you have a lot of friends, this can add up very quickly.

Gift each other
After you’ve invited all your friends and they have joined, you and your friends can gift each other Coin Master free spins and coins every day! You don’t lose any personal spins this way. In total, you can send and receive 100 spins
